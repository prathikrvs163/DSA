Example 1:

Input: arr = [17,18,5,4,6,1]
Output: [18,6,6,6,1,-1]
Explanation: 
- index 0 --> the greatest element to the right of index 0 is index 1 (18).
- index 1 --> the greatest element to the right of index 1 is index 4 (6).
- index 2 --> the greatest element to the right of index 2 is index 4 (6).
- index 3 --> the greatest element to the right of index 3 is index 4 (6).
- index 4 --> the greatest element to the right of index 4 is index 5 (1).
- index 5 --> there are no elements to the right of index 5, so we put -1.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [400]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: There are no elements to the right of index 0.

Explanation:
1. Take n as length of arr and max_right as -1
2. Iterate from the back
3. Take a temp variable and store the value of arr[i]
4. next assign the max_right value to the arr[i]
5. We'll get the max_right value by finding the max of max_right and temp.
6. Finalyy, return the arr.

Code:
class Solution:
    def replaceElements(self, arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n=len(arr)
        max_right=-1
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            temp=arr[i]
            arr[i]=max_right
            max_right=max(max_right, temp)
        return arr
