Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

Explanation:
1. first take two pointers i and j to 0
2. the both pointers should not cross the len of their respective strings
3. check s[i]==t[j] and increment if it goes on
4. Always increment j no matter what
5. And finally return i==len(s0

Code:
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        i=0
        j=0
        while i<len(s) and j<len(t):
            if s[i]==t[j]:
                i+=1
            j+=1
        if i==len(s):
            return True
        else:
            return False
